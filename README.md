# Math Problems

I created this site so that my daughter doesn't have to watch 30-second ads or pay a subscription to practice math
problems. My plan is to expand the quantity and types of problems over time.

A JavaScript-based project that generates math problems with interactive options and a built-in scratchpad for drawing
and annotating solutions. The project uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to display problems, handle user
interactions, and provide a fun, dynamic learning experience.

## Features

- Interactive math problems with multiple-choice options
- Scratchpad for handwritten notes and drawings
- Undo, redo, and clear functions in the scratchpad
- Animated stars for correct answers
- Responsive design and touch support for mobile devices

## Usage

1. Open the index.html file in your browser.
2. The first math problem will display with multiple-choice options.
3. Use the scratchpad on the side to work out your solutions:
    * Click on the Toggle Scratchpad button to open it.
    * Use your mouse or touch to draw on the canvas.
    * Use the Undo, Redo, and Clear buttons to manage your drawing.
4. Select an answer option to check if your answer is correct. Animated stars will appear for correct answers.
5. Navigate between problems using the provided navigation buttons.

## Project Structure

* index.html — Main entry point of the application.
* script.js — Contains the logic for math problems, event handlers, and the scratchpad.
* styles.css — Styles for the application layout and elements.
* README.md — Project documentation file.
